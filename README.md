Hello Everyone!

In this project I am trying to create a replica of Egg Inc. I have no plans to market this!!!

I am creating this project for educational purposes as I wanted to try making a game in Ue5 using C++ for the majority of the logic to help me learn the language.

If you have any tips or tricks I could use then please let me know!!
